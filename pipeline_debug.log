=== PIPELINE DEBUG ===

Subtasks:
 1. Research the definition of trigonometric identities.
 2. Identify a suitable trigonometric identity to apply in solving the expression 51^2 - 49^2.
 3. Recall and apply the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)) to factorize the expression.
 4. Simplify the resulting expression using basic arithmetic operations.
 5. Evaluate the simplified expression to obtain the final answer.
